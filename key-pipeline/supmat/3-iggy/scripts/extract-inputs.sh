# Extracts the inputs of a SIF file
# ---------------------------------
# This file is part of the Supplementary Material of the submission entitled:
# A pipeline to create predictive functional networks: application to the tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
# Authors: Maxime Folschette, Vincent Legagneux, Arnaud Poret, Lokmane Chebouba, Carito Guziolowski and Nathalie Th√©ret

###
# Extracts the inputs of a SIF file (nodes without predecessor)
###
# Usage:
#   sh extract-inputs.sh <SIF file>
# where <SIF file> is a SIF file you want the inputs extracted from
#
# Output:
#   A list of genes that have no predecessors in the model.
#
# Purpose:
#   The --auto_inputs option of Iggy does not work as intended;
#   the inputs have to be manually given in the obsersations file.
#   This can be done by calling this script then appending ' = input' to each line.
#   See construct-input.sh for the complete pipeline to build the observations file.
