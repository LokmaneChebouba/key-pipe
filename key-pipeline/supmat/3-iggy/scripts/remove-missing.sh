# Remove the missing genes from the observations
# ----------------------------------------------
# This file is part of the Supplementary Material of the submission entitled:
# Hepatocellular carcinoma computational models identify key protein-complexes associated to tumor progression
# Authors: Maxime Folschette, Vincent Legagneux, Arnaud Poret, Lokmane Chebouba, Carito Guziolowski and Nathalie Théret

###
# Remove the missing genes from the observations
###
# Usage:
#   bash remove-missing.sh <sif-file> [results-file]
# where <sif-file> is the SIF file used as an input by Iggy
# and [results-file] is a file containing the output of Iggy;
# if not specified, it is read from the standard input
#
# Output:
#   The original output file where all lines refering to missing genes are removed
#
# Example:
#   sh remove-missing.sh input/name-ssm-reg.sif output/name-ssm-reg.out
# Or:
#   iggy --show_predictions input/sif.sif input/obs.obs | sh iggy_to_cytoscape.sh input/updownreg.obs | bash sh remove-missing.sh input/sif.sif
#
# Remarks:
#   * Must be run with Bash (for process substitution)
#   * Some missing genes are “missed again” (still in the output) because
#       the -w grep option cuts words around dashes, but this is quite rare (probably < 1%)
#   * This script should work on Iggy's output with of without postprocessing,
#       but has only been tested on the result of iggy-to-cytostape.sh or compare-to-icgc.py
#   * This script uses get-genes-from-sif.sh, which is required
