###
# Construct the Iggy observations file by appending inputs to preliminary observations
###
# Usage:
#   sh construct-inputs.sh [--gen] <SIF file> <obs file>
# where --gen specifies that a “_gen” suffix should be appened to each preliminary observation,
# <SIF file> is a SIF file you want the inputs extracted from
# and <obs file> is a preliminary Iggy observation file containing only “ = +” and “ = -” observations
#
# Output:
#   A list of “ = input” observations containing genes that have no predecessors in the model,
#   appened to the initial observations file.
#
# Purpose:
#   The --auto_inputs option of Iggy does not work as inteded;
#   the inputs have to be manually given in the obsersations file.
#   This can be done by calling this script then appending ' = input' to each line.
